Hello Persistent Venture,
Thank you for the wonderful assignment.

Apologies for the delay; I am 2 hours late. I wasn't able to deliver this within 24 hours as I read the email quite late.

Setup:

Open the terminal and run the  command - https://github.com/pratik-71/Persistent_ven_ass.git
after that run - npm init
This will download all the necessary packages, and you are good to go.
to run project run command - npm run dev


Thank you!
